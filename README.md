# Hogwarts Game - Python Project

This is my first Python project! The Hogwarts Game is a simple interactive game that sorts the player into a house at Hogwarts based on a series of questions.

## Features
- Randomly assigns a Hogwarts house to the player.
- Asks multiple-choice questions to determine points for each house.
- Calculates and announces the winning house based on the player's answers.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
2. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python hogwarts-game-2025.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to answer the questions and see which house wins!

## Future Improvements
- Add more questions for better sorting accuracy.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Save player results and display statistics.
